We have arrived at SENTINEL IV by Simone Leigh. Built in 2020, Sentinel IV is a slender bronze guardian with elongated proportions and faceless bowl crown that exudes a mystical presence. In using the term “sentinel”—a person or thing that stands watch—Leigh honors Black femininity while also investigating historical and intersecting ideas of race, beauty, and the association of Black women’s bodies with work. Sited in the central courtyard of the Anna Hiss Gymnasium, Sentinel IV stakes radical claim to existence in a moment when Black existence, in particular, is persistently under threat. It holds space and holds court—an apt landmark poised to see, hear, and represent—to project Black presence into the future of The University of Texas at Austin and beyond, bearing witness to this indelible present.
We have arrived at MONOCHROME FOR AUSTIN by Nancy Rubins. Balancing with improbable grace, Monochrome for Austin boasts seventy recycled aluminum canoes and small boats clustered at the end of a listing column. It deploys a sense of mass and scale that can be compared to a performer’s perfect timing, a characteristic that is ever-present in the work of artist Nancy Rubins. Her sculptures combine surpassing delicacy and indomitable strength, a polarity that is even more striking when encountered outdoors.
We have arrived at CIRCLE WITH TOWERS by Sol LeWitt. Circle with Towers is, in effect, a low circular wall capped at regular intervals by eight rectangular towers made of pale gray concrete blocks. The outdoor structure possesses a discernable logic and rhythm: the concrete towers are four blocks wide while the low walls between them are eight blocks wide—a perfect 1:2 ratio. The concrete block structures are laid by hand, one block at a time by local masons. Like many of LeWitt’s works, Circle with Towers demonstrates the artist’s generosity in welcoming others to interpret his work, including the artists and craftspeople who realize his artistic visions.
